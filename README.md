#### Vegetable Market Price
This website is build to track the vegetables price. Price data will be collected on daily basis and stored in database. The history page will show the price history in chart. The price history rise and fall can be easily viewed in the chart. Once data collected it will be analysed with previous 30 days price. Much difference in the price will be noted in the bottom of the home page as price rise and fall view.This website is build to track the vegetables price.

#### Website scripting
Website scripting is a browser extension. It is used to inject a peice of javascript code into a website that you are configuring. It is similar like Tampermonkey extension, that was found out after developing. This extension has extra features. Like, we can test a script at run time without reloading the page and it has popup UI that will show you the exact script that is matched and injected currently. Also we can edit in the popup UI. And there is the configuration page that will show you all the script configuration. And importing and exporting a script functionality also there.Website scripting is a browser extension.
